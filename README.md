# Ethereum-lottery
<h3>About</h3>
This is a simple lottery game implemented with smart contract. In every game, the manager deploys the smart contract to a node in Rinkeby network. Any player can join the game by investing more than a certain amount of money. Then a winner is automatically chosen and all ETH are going to be sent to this guy. Then the player list is cleared and a new game starts.
